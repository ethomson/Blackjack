Description:
This is a very basic console-based blackjack simulation program.  The game
of blackjack is described at http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack.
The deal style is "American Blackjack" - after a round of betting, the
deal goes around the table such that players and dealer receive two cards.
The player cards are dealt face-up, the dealer receives one card face up
and one card face down.  Surrender is not allowed.

To play interactively, just run the program, eg:
  ./blackjack

To play the program to analyze a specific playing strategy, run:
  ./blackjack <strategyname>

  Currently implemented strategies are:
	basic - "basic" strategy - http://wizardsofodds.com/games/blackjack
	cardcount - Simple Tens Counting Strategy - simple card counting
				http://www.allaboutblackjack.com/cardcounting.html
	dealer - always hit until soft 17
	interactive - displays cards, prompts for play on the console

  When using a non-interactive strategy, the software will dump a
  total of statistics every 25,000 hands.  (It will display a win
  percentage for every possible initial player hand / dealer hand,
  as well as the current bankroll.)  An 80x40 line terminal is
  recommended.

Standard Vegas Blackjack rules apply, as:
- A 6 deck shoe is used for dealing cards.
- The object is to have a higher score than the dealer - each face card 
  (Jack, Queen, King) is worth 10, each Ace is worth 1 or 11, whichever
  most benefits the hand.
- Splitting Aces results in exactly one card per hand.
- Double after split is allowed.
- Blackjack on deal (a deal of 21 points -- Ace + face card or 10) pays
  the player 3:2.
- Insurance pays 2:1 and must be exactly 1/2 the players original bet.

Compilation:
GNU make is required.  Type 'make' in this directory to compile.
An executable named 'blackjack' will be created.

It is presumed to work under any unix platform with g++ and should work
under any standards-compliant C++ platform with minimal changes.
